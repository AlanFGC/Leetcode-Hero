# Leetcode-Hero

Hello âœŒ, this is my journey demonstrating how I prepare for interviews but also train to be a better engineer. Each submission tells a story, I hope you can get to know me better or help you understand that this process requires time and discipline, but it's definitely achievable.

Collection of LeetCode questions to ace the coding interview! - Created using [LeetHub](https://github.com/QasimWani/LeetHub)

Regarding code that I do not own:
  Leetcode is a learning platform and reverse engineering code from someone else is a great way to understand any difficult topic. I'm using an application that  
  automatically syncs my leetcode submissions to this repository. If code that is not mine ends up in this repo, this was NOT intended and I don't claim to be the 
  author. 
  Please notify me if you spot some code that is not mine. Thank you!
